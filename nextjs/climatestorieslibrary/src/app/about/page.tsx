          <h2>Why Focus on Climate?</h2>
          <p>We see the climate crisis as just one of many symptoms of a current way of being, particularly by a global minority. A way of being in the world that has also caused, and is causing, other forms of social injustice.</p>
          <p>As part of wider forms of unfair disadvantage, the climate crisis is one of the symptoms that affects all of us but in different ways. It connects us globally and, in doing so, it is an issue that can be used to connect with other health and wellbeing inequities, entangled with the climate crisis, which will differ for individuals from different localities and backgrounds.</p>

          <h2>Advisory Group</h2>
          <p>An advisory group of individuals from countries on the frontlines of the climate crisis is helping us shape this project so that it is as useful as possible to as many people as possible.
